# dotemacs

See `init.el` and then continue.

This is a very custom setup that may not be suitable for everyone. Itâ€™s
only been tested on a mac, with the emacs mac port.

## Setting up

1. This should be cloned to ~/opt/elisp

2. Symlinks

        ln -s ~/opt/elisp/.emacs ~/.emacs
        ln -s ~/opt/elisp/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d

3. Done!

## TODOs

- Migrate this to `~/.emacs.d` instead of requiring `~/opt/elisp`

- Snippets with yasnippet

- Window management with [shackle](https://github.com/wasamasa/shackle)

- Project management with [projectile](http://endlessparentheses.com/improving-projectile-with-extra-commands.html)

- Start using marks, bookmarks
